# Time-Is-Money

It's after lunch, the afternoon blues are hitting you. You just ate, you're a little tired, and you REALLY really don't want to be at work anymore. You check your watch... ugh five hours left.

Time is depressing, like really depressing. For example, when I think that statistically speaking I have about 60-65 years of my life left that's pretty depressing. What if there were another measurement of your progress of the work day?

Time is Money is the first app I remember being really proud of (and I still didn't even finish it), users are prompted to put in the amount they make per hour, and under the time the amount they've made for the day is displayed. From there all they have to do is clock in and clock out on the app, and progress via the dollar is saved. There are many visual graphs and such that display the user's progress (not fully implemented). After all, it's far better to make money than wait for time!

This is something I would like to finish one day.
